Search index for airports using BST and AVL search trees for Data Structures course of UoA

This project displays the complexity of BST and AVL trees using unsorted and sorted data and record their time.

From these results we conclude that the complexity of
AVL trees for unsorted as well as sorted data is O(logn) for
insert and search an it has a complexity of O(n) for printing. While BST with unsorted data has the same complexity with AVL trees, this is not the case for sorted data because it has a complexity of O(n) for all 3 operations.
